# citationvalidator
This script enriches and validates bibliographic entries in a LaTeX thesis project by automating metadata retrieval and comparing cited text with publication abstracts. It uses APIs like Crossref and PubMed, matches statements to abstracts using both TF-IDF and biomedical embeddings (BioBERT), and flags weakly supported claims.
